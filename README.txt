“Identify what aspects of the work have been correctly implemented and what have not.”
During the time spent building my website, I believe that I have correctly implemented most of the following things; 
Content 
The specified content within my website (online CV/portfolio) is relevant as well as readable. Also, the images that are involved within my online CV are also relevant as they complement the written content.
Consistent house style 
The house style chosen was consistent throughout the website. The fonts, colour and page style were influenced by my colleague/Friend’s website (Florence Twumasi Ankrah). The plan/layout of the website was like her own, the only difference was the font and colour scheme. I had chosen blue, white and yellow as the colour scheme as I felt it looked professional while captivating the viewer. The print screen shows a clear picture of the house style I used, this house style was consistent throughout.
Things I have not implemented correctly;
Plan/designs
Didn’t follow an actual plan/design as I kept changing or updating the design for the website. This was due to sharing ideas with my colleague. This was very risky as I felt as though I spent too much time creating the website, however, If I had a solid plan to follow I believe the creation of my website would have been a lot smoother, this wasting less time.

“Identify anyone with whom you have collaborated or discussed the assignment.”
I discussed this assignment with my friend Florence Twumasi Ankrah. We mainly discussed the type of house style we were going to implement when making the website. We had similar plans and design layouts as we shared thoughts and ideas when discussing the assignment.

“Say approximately how many hours you have spent completing the assignment.”
This assignment took roughly 5 – 7 days to complete.
