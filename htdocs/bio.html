    <p>My name is <b>Jason Bourne</b> I currently study business computing (web design) at the University of Northampton.
I picked this particular course because From an early age I have been completely amazed as to how computer databases and websites function
and despite all the knowledge that I have acquired over the years, I still am.
<br>

Nowadays it is incredibly rare that you will see a business
that does not possess a website or database of its own. My inspiration to pursue a career in IT has come from great people such as; Bill Gates,
and Brendan Eich, the designer of one of the worldâ€™s most high level programming languages, JavaScript as well as the founder of Mozilla Firefox.
For many years I have been intrigued by his career. Seeing technology advance has made me want to be a part of this wonderful process.</p>
<br>
<p>During my spare time, I watch basic JavaScript tutorials to gain enough knowledge so that I can be sufficiently
acquainted with the fundamentals of programming and scripting which I believe is extremely useful when studying
a course like this.</p>
